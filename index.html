    "The first Fluffy Handsome strip! It might not look like much now, but this comic is about to rip a hole in the fabric of (my?) reality. ",
"The second strip ever and already Fluffy is courting controversy! ",
"Ooh, I wonder what’s inside the marshmallow? ",
"We all start somewhere. ",
"Figures. You go all the way into outer space to broadcast an important message, and your audience is not even in the room. ",
"Fluffy’s having a rough night. ",
"Zip! ",
"Mozart’s piano concerto no. 27 in b flat does indeed sound heavenly. ",
"That line by Auden has always gotten to me…",
"When was the last time you danced when no music was playing? ",
"Just think about how old the pyramids are and try not to go insane. ",
"A word from our sponsors. Buy your copy at Records of Imaginal Origin",
"How is your meditation practice treating you these days? ",
"There’s a saying in Fancy City. “Watch enough Fluffy, [and] eventually you’ll learn everything.” ",
"Surf tuba, anyone? P.S. How did this get here? Before Fluffy Handsome, there was Flawed Masterpiece. Apparently a few of those snuck into the Fluffy file. ",
"A cool $15B could buy a hell of a lot of beer and Salty Bites. ",
"Oh, this one was sponsored by Merl’s Mirrors. That’s why it’s so weird. ",
"Another flawed masterpiece—this time, a quiet domestic scene. I used to love drawing these and often fancy a return to the genre…",
"Why, yes, I do love the work of David Lynch! How did you know? ",
"You’re a legend, Blake! ",
"I drew this in 2020—yes, I have been making banana art jokes since the beginning. They call me Attaboy, OG Banana. (Note to self: renew subscription to TAME.)",
"It is 2025. I haven’t thought of the Great Forgotten since 2021. I’ve failed you, Fluffy. ",
"Little Billy (middle panel, middle figure) sure is conscientious about buying whatever Fluffy’s selling. Let’s hope the T Rex talks some sense into him. ",
"Ugh. I wrote “Everone” instead of “everyone” and I was going through this phase where I would just let things be and try to put them in a positive spin rather than fix them past a certain point. The idea here was that Fluffy would always “mispronounce” the word “everyone” in this manner. Did I keep this up? Well, you’ll just have to read every single comic I ever write to find out!",
"What is happening behind Fluffy? Some kinda swirly train wreck? Is that why I can’t look away? ",
"This panel, like all of the Flawed Masterpiece series, was executed in the year of our Lord MMXX. And history has been laughing ever since. ",
"Me-oh-my-oh! (I had so much fun drawing Fluffy’s radio studio, listening to Fats all the while. Bliss.)",
"This strip is a Key to the Mystery of Fluffy Handsome. ",
"Fluffy knows. ",
"Any questions? ",
"NGL, I have a crush on the lead singer/keytarist. Fun tip: if you get bored, count how many buttons and dials I fit into that gear that the bassist is fiddling with in the far left corner of the stage.",
"I used to have a mantra when I drew these early strips: “Love every brick.” ",
"Yes, Little Billy has a friend named Billy. No, I will not share any further lore on this topic at this point. ",
"Is that an airport, or is that an airport? That’s an airport in the middle of my comic, y’all. ",
"For the record, I love scrambled eggs. But not so much when I was Little Billy’s age.",
"Ever notice how some furniture is OK for feet, and some is not? ",
"I want to know more about this epic battle between aeroplane and thunder lizard. ",
"You see, kids? You never run out of ideas if you work without ideas to begin with! ",
"Dood! Sick! Burrrrrrnn *passes out*",
"I still want to know — what is INSIDE the marshmallow? ",
"I could go for a smoothie right about now. ",
"Yes. I wasted an entire strip to call out this weird speech habit of Fluffy’s. Brazen. ",
"Another Key to the Mystery of Fluffy Handsome. ",
"They haven’t made a helmet yet that can prevent a broken heart, though. ",
"Can you find any hints in this one? ",
"I drew this one after a rewatch of Wings of Desire. ",
"Fluffy's drinking again. ",
"I mean, in the face of that flower, who needs a point? ",
"You know what? I’m still thinking about getting a smoothie. ",
"Insurance commercials, amiright?!",
"Man, EVERONE is wearing Fluffy Handsome slippers these days! ",

"OK, FINALLY, the Show’s about to start…",
"This is when the comic goes from randomness to story. Buckle up! ",
"Grunt Daggerjab: reluctant barbarian warlord. ",
"Based on a true story. ",

"Fuzz Dapper truly is the model middle management minion, no? ",
"Oh, come on! How bad could it be, Fluffy?!",
"This is… umm… special. ",
"Y’all know this Buzz Slouch character is how I am afraid I would act if I ever meet any of my heroes, right? The guy LOVES Fluffy Handsome. Superfan. It’s sad, really.",
"Buzz has met the Buddha on the road. ",
"Excel IS a great tool.",
"Fluffy has a great ass. That’s canon. ",
"This comic is a Key to the Mystery of Fluffy Handsome. #fluffyhandsomeisreal if you feel moved to share the good word.",
"Welcome to the Blank Page. No tour guides. ",
"IS Reason over-rated? ",
"It takes a Fopsquire to experience total freedom and call it a dungeon. ",
"Our Friends Incorporate are not known for friendliness when it’s down to the wire.",
"This is, as of January 2025, the last appearance of Fuzz Dapper. ",
"Buzz Slouch looks like a Cenobite when he’s anxious. ",
"This is a Key to the Mystery of Fluffy Handsome. #whereisfluffyhandsome if you feel moved to share the good word. ",
"If you’re gonna crack, there’s no better place than on the Blank Page. ",
"But the most Cenobite of all my characters must be Professor Fopsquire. ",
"Are you following all this? Take good notes. There will be a quiz. ",
"I’m beginning to think the Blackberry was a bad idea. ",
"Just a reminder: this comic was written in 2021. ",
"Why do I keep delaying the Secret of Secrets? Is it for dramatic effect? Or is it because I don’t really know what it is and I’m struggling to come up with something cool? Bless my bowels! ",
"Loose lips sink ships, Buzz. ",
"This is a Key to the Mystery of Fluffy Handsome. #letfluffyhandsomebe if you feel moved to share the good word. ",
"Sus. ",
"Pretty cool trick, how I can just possess Fluffy like that, huh? ",
"This is fairly self-explanatory, I should think. ",
